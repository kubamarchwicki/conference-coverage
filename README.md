# The Conference Coverage List

## What is this?

This is a list of conferences which shows how much various conferences pay for travel and other expenses. It can help you find conferences which cover all of your needs so you are actually able to attend.

The idea behind this was sparked by [Lukas Eder](https://twitter.com/lukaseder/status/889837600776871936) after a GoFundMe campaign by [Laurent BourgÃ¨s](https://www.gofundme.com/javaone-2017-travel-costs).

## How to contribute?

This is a Markdown table. So you can just fork the repository and add a conference to the list. Submit a pull request and we'll add it as quickly as we can!

Please also note we observe a [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)

## Terminology

You can use the following emoji to signify whether conference covers the given expense or not. You can find the appropriate code to write them at the end of each line.

* :x:  - Not covered - `:x:`
* :question: - Unsure - `:question:`
* :heavy_check_mark: - Covered - `:heavy_check_mark:`

If the conference covers only part of the costs, please add an annotation in parentheses:

> :heavy_check_mark: (50% of travel)

| Conference name | Website | Travel? | Accommodation? | Diversity initative? | Other expenses? |
